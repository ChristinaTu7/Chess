Contributions: We both contributed to creating each class. Helping each other understanding or writting out a program


Compile: Make sure that the directory is in the project 2 folder. Once in the folder, cd to the src folder
and then run the game file with "java Game"


Additional Features: We implemented a method that crowns a pawn when it reaches the last row on the board on the opposite
side of the player. The player then chooses which promotion they want their pawn to promote to. This was implemented in the piece.java file


Bugs: There were many times where our chess board won't work when showing the piece but the testing would work and
vice versa. We also had some bugs when it came to the test files with the getAnnotation method.


I certify that the information contained in this README
file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
